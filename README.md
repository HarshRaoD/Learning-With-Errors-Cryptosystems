# Ring Learning with Errors

### TODO
1. Introduce Learning with errors (LWE) - Theory
2. Show how to brute force a basic learning with errors encryption scheme - Code & Graphs
    1. Draw some graph animations to show how the search space is reduced
    2. Maybe time complexity graphs
3. Introduce RLWE (Ring LWE) and MLWE (Module RWE) - Theory
